### Edit/new builder

The edit/new builder is used to configure the form which is displayed when creating or editing an object.

The edit builder and the new builder can be considered the same: they both deliver a form, with the difference that one is already filled with data from your database. However, the configuration is splitted, allowing you to customize them seperate.

You can read more about the edit/new builder in [it's own documentation page][edit-builder].

### List builder

The list builder is used to configure the list view. You can read more about the list builder in [it's own documentation page][list-builder].

### Filters builder

The filters builder is used to configure the filters which are displayed on the list view. You can read more about the list builder in [it's own documentation page][list-builder].

### Excel builder

The excel builder is used to configure the Excel export of the current list. Keep in mind that the filters currently applied to the list, are also applied to the export.
