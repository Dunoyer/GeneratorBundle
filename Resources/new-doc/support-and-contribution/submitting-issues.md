### Step 1: Check existing issues

Go to [our issues page][docs-issues] and search existing issues, your problem may have been answered there already.


### Step 2: Check google groups

Go to [our google group][docs-google] and search existing threads, your problem may have been answered there already.


### Step 3: Ask on Gitter

You can always ask for support in our [Gitter][docs-gitter]. You are free to ask questions, however keep in mind that there is not always someone who can answer them.


### Step 4: Create new issue

You can create an issue using [Github][docs-issues], using [Github Flavored Markdown][docs-markdown] are much more human-readable. To create a new issue go to [Github issues][docs-issues] and click on the **New issue** button (or use [this shortcut][docs-new-issue]).


##### Basic formatting guide

While writing your issue please use Github Flavored Markdown to make it more readable. If you paste any code **wrap it in github's code block!** To do that start with 3 **```** characters, then name language you're useing, for example **yaml**:

> **```yaml**
> 
> my.yaml_code:  is here
> 
> **```**

which will resuilt in
```yaml
my.yaml_code:  is here
```

To learn how to use Github Flavoured Markdown simply click on the *Github Flavored Markdown* link above the text field to see!
